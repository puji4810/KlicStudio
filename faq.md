### 1. Cannot see the `app.log` configuration file, unable to know the error content
Windows users please place the working directory of this software in a folder that is not on the C drive.

### 2. The configuration file was clearly created for the non-desktop version, but still reports "Configuration file not found"
Ensure that the configuration file name is `config.toml`, not `config.toml.txt` or something else. After configuration, the structure of the working folder for this software should look like this:
```
/── config/
│   └── config.toml
├── cookies.txt （<- Optional cookies.txt file）
└── krillinai.exe
```

### 3. Filled in the large model configuration, but reports "xxxxx requires configuration of xxxxx API Key"
Although both the model service and voice service can use OpenAI's services, there are scenarios where the large model uses non-OpenAI services separately. Therefore, these two configurations are separate. In addition to the large model configuration, please look for the whisper configuration below to fill in the corresponding keys and other information.

### 4. Error contains "yt-dlp error"
The issue with the video downloader currently seems to be either a network problem or a downloader version issue. Check if the network proxy is enabled and configured in the proxy configuration item of the configuration file, and it is recommended to choose a Hong Kong node. The downloader is automatically installed by this software; I will update the installation source, but since it is not the official source, it may be outdated. If you encounter problems, try updating it manually. The update method is:

Open the terminal in the software's bin directory and execute
```
./yt-dlp.exe -U
```
Here, replace `yt-dlp.exe` with the actual name of the ytdlp software on your system.

### 5. After deployment, subtitle generation is normal, but the synthesized subtitles embedded in the video have a lot of garbled characters
Most of this is due to missing Chinese fonts on Linux. Please download the [Microsoft YaHei](https://modelscope.cn/models/Maranello/KrillinAI_dependency_cn/resolve/master/%E5%AD%97%E4%BD%93/msyh.ttc) and [Microsoft YaHei Bold](https://modelscope.cn/models/Maranello/KrillinAI_dependency_cn/resolve/master/%E5%AD%97%E4%BD%93/msyhbd.ttc) fonts (or choose fonts that meet your requirements), and then follow the steps below:
1. Create a msyh folder under /usr/share/fonts/ and copy the downloaded fonts to this directory.
2. 
    ```
    cd /usr/share/fonts/msyh
    sudo mkfontscale
    sudo mkfontdir
    fc-cache
    ```
